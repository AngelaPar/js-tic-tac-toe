# Tic Tac Toe (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This was my first time exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when I was 14, building a classic Tic Tac Toe game with a computer player. It marks the start of my journey into frontend web development and game logic.

Projects like this helped me realize how much I enjoy breaking down challenges into smaller parts and piecing them together to create a working game.
